Navigate challenging educational settings, manage medical needs (including critical care), cook five basic dinners over and over, engage in Sisyphean cleaning, love on demand. Brief, and lovely, foray into the world of venture capital. Helped newly seeded companies head hunt. Loved working at Amazon. It was a crazy time of insane growth and everyone was talented and dedicated and knew that the customer always came first. I wish I had a picture of my door desk. Worked with recruiting heroes: John Vlastelica and Dave Gerbitz. Recruited engineering talent for this incredibly smart and talented group which should have been PayPal, but sold to Amazon and became their bulletproof payment system, not too shabby. Remember the bad ol' days? Yes, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times (if, like me, you didn't cash out your options the minute you bought them. Oops.) Had a blast here. Recruited everything and tried to stay away from the cable guys (no offense). Worked with some content geniuses: Roger Black, Richard Gingras, James Albrecht, Ty Ahmad Taylor. Recruited engineers and animators for Michael Huskins' search firm focused on the entertainment industry. He was a bundle of energy and really understood the art of career management. Clients: Disney Interactive, Sony Entertainment and Z-Axis. Eternal thanks to Neil Sims and Lisa Sheehan for teaching me the trade of intelligent recruiting.  I smiled and dialed and learned how to talk to engineers and manage the recruiting process. This was a successful south of market boutique recruiting firm before ""south of market"" meant much. They were way ahead of the curve, understood the market and had very loyal clients. I worked closely with Berkeley Systems -- remember the flying toasters? Clients: Macromedia, the 3DO Company, Oracle Corp, PF Magic, Motion Works, Avantos. The Money Fund was the companion to the successful donations-linked Working Assets charge cards. Great folks. Went with Michael Kieschnick when he left Working Assets and started the Muir Fund --- socially responsible CA municipal bond fund. Great team, good times, clean investments. Met Jim Camp when I was at the Equitable and jumped at the chance to work with this sales genius. At the time we were selling insurance and financial representatives a version of the Sandler Sales System.  Very fun, learned a lot. Have no idea what I was thinking.  Went to Alumnae Resources in SF, met an interesting woman who'd make a lot of money in insurance and told me to give it a try, so I did. Eeesh. Guys doing coke in the bathroom, cold calling, the smell of desperation in the bull pen. Arrived in San Francisco with a liberal arts degree and no idea what I should do with my life. Realized men (and some women) all around me were dying of AIDS. Signed up to volunteer (providing one-on-one emotional support to people with AIDS) and ended up working at Shanti. Was an amazing center of love and giving in an unfortunate hub of grief and dying. My best job was at the back-up reception desk of a law firm on the 40th floor of the Embarcardero in SF. I was new to town so I LOVED it. ""Steefel, Levit and Weiss, may I help you? Steefel, Levitt and Weiss, may I help you?"" Ran classroom-style education sessions for Freshman on personal safety, communication and self-defense."

I make my own schedule, run my own office, maintain and manage inventory, client information, and marketing. This job requires organization, time management skills, people skills, and self-confidence. Kids with Ongoing Diseases or Illnesses (KODI), a charitable, tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) organization, is committed to empowering single parents and their children through a three-point process: 1.) to provide both one-on-one and peer emotional support designed to connect and form lasting relationships as well as assist in crisis situations, and 2.) to support advocacy in the community by addressing the needs and concerns of parents and their children, and 3.) to provide financial assistance to families in order to strengthen social opportunities that may not otherwise exist so that parents will feel re-energized and empowered with renewed hope. As payroll coordinator I am a liaison between employees and the payroll-processing department. This position requires computer knowledge, math skills, organizational skills and the ability to communicate effectively. In this position, I served families of individuals with all disabilities: physical, cognitive, emotional, and learning. As a Parent Training and Information Center, we help families obtain appropriate education and services for their children with disabilities; work to improve education results for all children; train and inform parents and professionals on a variety of topics; resolve problems between families and schools or other agencies; and connect those with disabilities to community resources that address their needs. Knowledge of chart organization and patient confidentiality practices were crucial. I was responsible for obtaining dictation and patient records from physicians, transferring the dictation to hard copy and applying to the patient's permanent record. I was also responsible for maintaining patient records held in the Clinic as well as managing correspondence and creating many of the forms used inside and outside the Clinic. This position required constant learning and expansion of skills. Duties included maintenance of patient charts, telephone communication with patients and others and special assignments. These responsibilities required working directly with patients and Clinical staff in a proactive manner to meet the medical records needs of the group. Rotation throughout the Clinic provided cross-coverage of important job assignments. Routine duties for protection, care and supervision of adolescents admitted to Adolescent Residential Program. This position required CPR, First Aid and Fire Safety training as well as Montana State Medication Certification, MANDT training and certification, blood borne pathogen safety training and a driver's awareness course. Various general office duties including typing, filing, phone coverage, mass mailings, student services and some light personal computer work. Confidentiality practices and organizational skills were a must. This position required knowledge of every aspect of the store and the ability to relay that information to a new and/or inexperienced employee. This took both great leadership and teamwork skills along with an enhanced level of customer service and people skills."

5112,"Social Media for Homeless Animals Grant writer/Prospect Research Philadelphia Grants Examiner Director of Development Director, Grants & Development Community Affairs Mangager Earhart Fellow, Graduate student in political science","Raising awareness and rescue for homeless animals through social media.  With over 20 years of experience in nonprofit settings including health care, human services, arts and media, I am a freelance grant writer and prospect researcher. My strength is in defining common goals between funders and nonprofits, developing realistic budgets, identifying funders in the foundation and corporate community, and writing grant applications that raise money. Grantmakers In a half-time telecommuting role for this vocational rehabilitation nonprofit, I reported to the President/CEO and focused on prospect research and grant writing. In collaboration with President, successful grant applications included awards from Kessler Foundation, Gannett Foundation, Dolfinger McMahon Foundation, William G. Rohrer Charitable Foundation and Danellie Foundation.  To support the capital campaign, I wrote the case for support, ancillary materials and delivered comprehensive profiles of major gift prospects.  To expand the organization's capacity to pursue federal contract opportunities, I initiated its affiliation with NISH, now named SourceAmerica, a national nonprofit that creates employment opportunities for people with disabilities. I also established its relationship with New Jersey Institute of Technology's Procurement Technical Assistance Center.  A telecommuting employee, I designed an intranet to promote remote communications among the organization’s staff and to secure a cost-effective online data repository.  I also maintained the organization's website.  Originally retained as a grant writer for the Foundation, my role expanded in response to the need for this type of professional support within the hospital system. I was charged with idenfitying  funders and writing  grant applications for relevant projects; acting on physician requeststo research funding sources in the context of current peer-reviewed literature; initeracting with board, funding sources, physicians and pertinent staff; and active board development. 
In primary grantwriter function, I researched & wrote Cooper's first application funded by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (for Cooper House). Wrote grant applications in multiple medical disciplines, including pediatrics (child-life services), medicine (cardiology) and community-based services (Cooper House, mobiile medical clinic), among others. I also hosted the Association of Fundraising Professionals' meetings in southern New Jersey on several occasions at the Foundation's offices.  
Initially hired to assist in preparing public and private grant applications, I advanced to lead agency's first Community Affairs Department. My diverse role included identifying funding sources, relationships among potential donors, writing grant applications, acting as  liaison with funders, board and other agency leadership, and overseeing list development.  I developed community-based support, including outstanding corporate leaders (Philadelphia-based CEOs) and public servants (Philadelphia City Council). Other highlights:  I coordinated agency's 20th anniversary celebration; developed and wrote successful applications for multiple funding sources, including Pew Charitable Trusts, for Centro Primavera, an after-school program for children at risk for substance abuse (age 5-12) which was continued after the funding period.  Center for the Study of Federalism expired with the passing of Daniel Elazar, PhD, the brilliant scholar and Center founder. I was awarded this prestigious fellowship through my mentor at Russell Sage College and Dr. Elazar's recommendation. The Earhart Foundation is based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. As Earhart Fellow, I had the extraordinary opportunity to providing professional research/writing support for Dr. Elazar, attend a number of extraordinary international forums and to pursue graduate studies. I also wrote, with Dr. Elazar's direction and Center Senior Fellows, a $100,000 grant application, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, for a summer institution in Big Sky, Montana, to enhance secondary school teachers' curriculum to teach federalism."

6218,Marketing Manager Geoffrey Stores Director of  Advertising/Creative Marketing Services Vice President Marketing Director Marketing Services Advertising Consultant Director Marketing Services,"Working on a cross functional team consisting of representatives from Marketing, Merchandising, Operations and Real Estate assembled to develop a single store format that would bring all the divisions of Toys”R”Us together under one roof. The goal was to test the format in current markets where we believed a single store with all categories made more sense than three separate stores.  Also to test in selected smaller markets where the expense structure of three separate stores was not cost effective.  Within the first year we had tested and selected a name, developed store formats, floor plans and a host of new services to test. Our next step was to formulate a marketing plan to open four concept stores in smaller markets. Within 12 months we had the first four stores opened in smaller markets and the favorable results allowed us to move forward with the second phase in current markets. In year two of the project we selected nine stores in one market, developed a renovation and marketing plan to open these stores in 8 months.  The results of the test proved the combination in current markets increased store visits by 10% and the average sale by approximately 12%. Managed the $120 million media, advertising, creative service, media and promotion planning for this $1.5 billion diverse portfolio of consumer products. 

•  In first year reduced design and print production expenses by 15%.  This was accomplished through a complete vendor review and initiating RFP’s for services.
• Working with the brand team we developed  a new advertising and media strategy for PAM cooking spray.  This effort was instrumental in the brand achieving a 4% increase in base line sales over the prior year.
•  Spearheaded a new agency search for Gulden’s.  Together with the brand team we launched an advertising campaign to support the repositioning of the brand.  Top line results reported a 12% increase over the same period of the prior year.
• Maximized the companies return on TV advertising spending through strong negotiations in the upfront market and initiating tracking reports to monitor media dollars actually spent vs. planned by media by brand. • Created and implemented an integrated advertising plan for opening 133 floor covering departments in just six months, in a regional Home Center chain in Florida.
• Developed a customer profile for each of the three different chains we managed.  Utilized these profiles to create targeted mailings for catalogs, direct mail promotions and a “Preferred Customer” Loyalty Program. Faced with rising costs due to increases in postage, print materials and the need to maintain our reach and frequency in our direct mail, I immediately pulled together a team to conduct a review of the entire direct mail program.  Upon completion of our review we recommended more efficient press products and reduced the overall print and postage costs of the direct mail programs by $1.6 million dollars. 
 
In an effort to revive a floundering co-branded credit card program I was asked to join a task force assigned the responsibility of reviewing the current program and developing a plan that would increase the number of members and increase usage.  Our revival plan included initiating an instant credit feature at POS, adding a private label card to compliment our co-branded card and added a program that rewarded holders for use and encouraged additional store visits. Completed a review of the advertising, promotion planning, creative development and production procedures for the Grocery Products Division of this $26.5 billion dollar consumer packaged goods conglomerate.  As a result the company adopted my recommendations and saved $2.5 million dollars. As Toys”R”Us and Babies”R”Us were merging into one team I was tasked with bringing together two separate Project Management groups. My first goal was to unify and organize the team with the objective of developing one process for producing all multi-channel advertising materials to support print, digital and social media. I set up meetings with each of team members identified their strengths and reorganized the team into three groups to serve the key media categories. 

Challenged with rising production costs and the need to reduce creative process timelines I recognized the need to revamp the aged and outdated advertising production process.  My first action was to conduct a search to find a new resource for our ad event production system. I assembled a task force, we developed a proposal format, identified potential companies, set up interviews and reviewed each of the organization’s capabilities. At the completion of our review we entered into an agreement with a new resource and launched the new ad event tool according to plan. The new system saved $900 thousand dollars over the first two years and reduced the production timelines by two weeks."

I used a cart to walk to get what the customers ordered and put the product on the 3 shelves of the cart. The products were from my ankles to a  little over my hands reach over my head. I packed, checked and put back-to-stock extras that the puller pulled. When the order was done, I numbered the boxes, labeled them, then put them on the rolling belt. I cleaned up my table, broke down boxes for re-use and other things. When some product was out, I asked the forklift to re stock what was out."

10238,Sales Associate Photographer,"As a sales associate for Ultimate Racing Competitors (URC), I helped brainstorm ideas about where and how to sell with the founder, and also as a part time graphics designer, I was given the task to design business cards for URC. 
As day to day tasks go, I would answer phone calls from interested customers as well as business associates and proceed to inform them of what URC stands for and how URC products can be beneficial to automobiles. As a Photographer, my first few tasks consisted of building the set, which includes: 
- setting up lights
- setting up back drop
- setting up timer
- positioning lighting
- directing reflector aids

After that process was finished, the next step was to begin shooting models. This main task would start the technical movements of different objects, which would reflect the photographers artistic eye. Lights, reflectors and camera angles would be directed around the stage to accomplish this task."

12406,Independent Field Agent Sales Professional/ Interim GM Supervisor Assistant Operations Manager Manager Assistant Director,"I am an independent field agent for USHA and I am loving being part of something bigger than myself. I am absolutely thrilled about this company and what they have to offer the public. Insurance and Healthcare is a messy maze to navigate... so let me help you. 

I enjoy having a position that offers a flexible schedule and a group of amazing people to share in the success. This position taught me everything I know now about sales and the sales process. I was in charge of everything customer or guest related. From the second a guest walked in the door, or a customer came in with a complaint of some sort, they were in my care. I recruited an average of 55 new members each month to the gym, as well as fostering 10 new business relationships in the local area in regards to marketing and promotion. Once our GM was no longer with GG, I was approached and offered the position of Interim GM. I accepted, and performed the position for about 3 months before I realized it was not the position for me and my happiness. 

I love the fitness industry; it is one of my passions. I am currently looking for a position that will provide me with the financial means to thrive in life. I am happily employed full time at 24 Hour Fitness in Littleton, CO off of Santa Fe and Belleview Ave. 

I started work here as a part time front desk service representative, and was promoted to Kids Club Supervisor within first 2 months of employment. It is a joy to come into work every day with a smile on my face, and know that I am also helping improve the lives of those around me. 

The Kids Club in 24 Hour Fitness is our version of a day care center for children of members ranging in age from 6 months old to 12 years old.

Come check us out in there any time!

I worked directly under the Executive Director, and was in charge of handling all tasks assigned to me each day. Most of my work involved getting in touch with various personnel in the community, such as vendors, businessmen, and past acquaintances on a daily basis. Fundraising is what thrives the foundation, who's ultimate goal is to support all Littleton Public Schools ranging from elementary to high school. I worked with ConstantContact, as well as other social media sites to get in touch with the community. 

Event Management was also done at this position - the LPS Foundation manages a public 5K walk/run called the Littleton Stride, which the Executive Director and I both worked on together to put on. For this event, I was also put on numerous errands each day, putting together and taking orders, selecting vendor banners, and coordinating all the volunteer help for the event. I truly enjoyed my time working at the foundation, and was not able to get approval for my position in the 2013 year, which was why I did not return."

I flagged for about two weeks and was offered a Crew Leader Position, which I did accept and done quite well. The duties of a flagger is to safely navigate any and all approaching traffic through a work zone or any other road activity that may be occupying the road. A flagger may use a stop and go paddle, a light wand, hand signals,flags, and any other traffic control approved devices to alert, direct and control the oncoming traffic. My duties as a Crew Leader was to make sure all my guys were fully equipped, alert, and briefed on the task at hand.

Our device allows customers to easily split the bill at the table as well provide real-time feedback to the restaurant.

http://www.uvore.com/ I spent approximately 60% of my time doing due diligence on companies to determine whether or not AEA should invest in them and 40% doing portfolio management, which primarily consisted of doing analysis or any other tasks needed to help the companies that AEA owns maximize their value. On the due diligence side, I did a lot of research, analysis and financial modeling geared toward answering several questions including: “Is the market that the target company competes in attractive?”, “How is the target company differentiated against its competitors?’; “Is the target company in a good position to win in this market?” On the portfolio management side, I spent 6 months directly helping a recently acquired company. While there, I worked directly with the CEO, CFO and senior management team on several initiatives including: weighing the pros/cons of pursuing a radically different customer strategy, creating a plan to help the company grow in a very attractive market, in which it had a limited presence and, more tactically, creating financial standards and KPIs to monitor and evaluate the performance of the business. Engaged with a diverse set of clients, ranging from a national provider of lawn fertilizing services to a publicly traded financial services company. Through these engagements, I had a lot of experience evaluating the attractiveness of a market, identifying opportunities for our clients to take advantage of current and/or future market dynamics and implementing practical solutions to help them execute on strategic initiatives. In addition to strategy cases, I had experiences in organizational structure optimization and cost-cutting. In these roles, I directly interviewed senior management, customers, and competitors to gather data; created, launched and analyzed surveys for primary research; created business and quantitative models to understand the size of the opportunity, identify the financial impact of pursuing one strategy vs. another, etc.; and created presentations to clearly communicate findings and recommendations to clients."

Deans, Program Chairs, Program Directors, and other hiring managers at many colleges and universities have a hard time attracting qualified professionals who want to teach part-time in their programs. These academic administrators have a hundred other things to do and do not have the time to conduct a full job search for qualified candidates for every course needing an instructor.

At the same time, there are successful professionals out there who are interested in teaching part-time at the college level. They don’t know exactly how to get their foot in the door or the cumbersome application process becomes too much of a hassle. They simply want to teach a course or two a semester to add to their resume, give back and share their practical knowledge with eager minds, and be in conversation with thought leaders in their field.

To solve this problem, we created a one-stop resource that can bring the two together. It is fast, easy, efficient and most of all, effective. Achievement U received 501(c)3 status November 2011.
